                <p>
                    P.T. Barnum is known for his showmanship and ability to captivate the audience with his uniquely extraordinary shows. The man himself would not be able to reach his status as America&apos;s greatest showman if it were not for his talented circus acts. One of Barnum&apos;s performing acts grew widely popular among the masses to the point where the title &apos;circus act&apos; would not be enough to encapsulate his level of fame. His name is Charles Stratton, popularly known as &apos;General Tom Thumb.&apos; With his innate talent in performance and mimicry, Stratton saw great success in America and overseas, gaining the acclaim of the US President Abraham Lincoln and the Queen of Great Britain, Queen Victoria. Another act, who brought a huge amount of profit and success to P.T. Barnum&apos;s enterprise, was Jenny Lind, who was often referred to as the &apos;Swedish Nightingale.&apos; Lind&apos;s beautiful singing voice enchanted the hearts of many people. During the war, Lind sang patriotic songs about a united country, which greatly resonated with war-torn America. P.T. Barnum understood the importance of entertainment for the American people. He marketed Lind and Stratton in a way that would touch people&apos;s hearts and make them forget about their country&apos;s current predicament. With Barnum&apos;s marketing techniques and business maneuvers, Lind and Stratton&apos;s talents and charms caught the attention of the general public. The impact of Barnum&apos;s business actions on the entertainment industry remains present and relevant even in modern-day America.

        <h1>“Distraction is a major ingredient in America&apos;s preoccupation with greed.”</h1>
        <p>P.T. Barnum was not only a showman who managed and directed his performing acts&apos; stages, but also a businessman whose drive and motivation was to accumulate profits, wealth, exposure, and gain social and political importance.

        <h1>Imaginary Ideals</h1>
        <p>Celebrities, especially actors and models, are receiving as an occupation of imaginary ideals in people&apos;s minds due to “their expertise lying in channeling other people&apos;s visions.” (Monbiot) This means that celebrities are more of a projection of the audience&apos;s own ideals rather than being real people themselves. Whether they are aware of it or not, celebrities become a dependent source of entertainment for people who wish to be entertained. Their lack of sense of self allows the audience to fill in the blanks of their personality and craft an image of the audience&apos;s ideals onto the public figure.
        </p>
        <p>Jenny Lind and Charles Stratton became symbols of the political unrest during that time because they were the sole celebrities that people clung to, to forget about the reality the country was facing. Jenny Lind sang about peace and unity. Charles Stratton imitated and mocked political figures and even political issues about racism, for he only catered to white audiences and was white himself. The American people adored Lind for her kindness, humanitarianism, and being non-English. Charles Stratton was adored partly because of his outward mockery of the political figures people did not like (this is not to say that Stratton does not have any other talents).</p>

        <h1>Disappointed Abolitionists</h1>
        <p>A New England quartet called Hutchinson Family Singers, who were abolitionists, visited Lind after her arrival. Jesse Hutchinson wrote a song titled “Welcome to Jenny Lind” with lyrics that praise Lind while also giving the impression of wanting Lind to back up their antislavery cause. They sang, “From the snow-clad hills of Sweden, like a bird of love from Eden, Lo! She comes with songs of freedom, Jenny comes from o&apos;er the sea.”</p>
        <p>However, Jenny Lind ignored the implications by praising their performance. Even to this day, people are yet to know Lind&apos;s stance on slavery despite her public image of being charitable, pure, and kind. Her disinterest in the topic of slavery led to disappointment from the abolitionists. Abolitionists wanted her to demonstrate her “support” (if she had one) to the antislavery cause by extending her philanthropy to abolitionist organizations. There was a rumor that Lind donated a thousand dollars to an antislavery cause, which Barnum quickly denied for fear of alienating the pro-slavery South.
